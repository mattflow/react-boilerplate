# React Boilerplate

This is a very minimal boilerplate that can be used to get started on a react application.

## Setup

```sh
git clone git@github.com:mattflow/react-boilerplate.git my-react-app
cd my-react-app
npm run setup
npm run start
```

Clone the repository into whatever directory you would like and then navigate into that directory. Running `npm run setup` will clean the git repository and install all dependencies. Now running `npm run start` will compile the app and open the dev server at *http://localhost:8080*.

## Production

To build for production, simply run `npm run build`
